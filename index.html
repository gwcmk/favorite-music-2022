      <h1>My Favorite Songs of 2022</h1>

      <p>
        It’s been a tough year for me, but I’m glad that I was able to find so much meaning, comfort, and joy in the
        music I loved. For so many of these songs, I have memories that I think will stick with me for many years to
        come.
      </p>
      <p>There’s a moment that I don’t think I’ll ever forget while I was at Phoebe Bridgers’ set at Coachella. I was
        still feeling numb about everything. She was performing the same set that I had seen a few months earlier at the
        Greek Theatre in Berkeley, and it was impossible not to think about the parallels between then and how I felt in
        that moment. Despite being surrounded by my friends and so many people, I overwhelmingly felt so alone. Midway
        through that set, she performed a new song. That was my first time hearing Sidelines, and looking back now,
        hearing her sing the chorus was the first time that I really started to consider how much love has changed my
        life.</p>
      <p class="quote">Watch the world from the sidelines<br>
        Had nothing to prove<br>
        Till you came into my life<br>
        Gave me something to lose<br>
        Now I know what it feels like<br>
        To wanna go outside<br>
        Like the shape of my outline<br>
      </p>
      <p>As I’ve reflected about the past few years, I’ve thought a lot about what has changed since the lowest points
        in my life, and what Phoebe is singing about here is undoubtedly the biggest reason for the changes since then.
        There’s a quote I like from Thomas Merton in <em>All About Love</em> about the transformative power of love:
        “Genuine love is a
        personal revolution. Love takes your ideas, your desires, and your actions and welds them together in one
        experience and one living reality which is a new you.” Thinking about this gives me so much hope for the future.
        I’ll keep hanging on to that.</p>
